Research infrstructures and communities: MERIL (Mapping of the European Research Infrastructure Landscape) portal. This document/report/presentation/analysis has been fully/partially based on data/information provided by the MERIL-2 project (Mapping of the European Research Infrastructure Landscape). MERIL-2 has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 654296. http://portal.meril.eu/portal/

Developers note: I contacted the MERIL project, but was under deadline to use the data. Given the high quality of the data (which is a compliment for the MERIL project) and a tight deadline, and the apparent unavailability of a public API and/or a way to download the data, I proceeded to write a small script to download and parse the data from the available website.
